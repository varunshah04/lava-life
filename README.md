This repository contains some of the projects I made for my *Data Structures* and *Large-scale Software Development and Design* classes:

**Address Book**: A project that implements an address book (using a linked list) that stores two kinds of contacts - people and businesses. Both these types of contacts have a name, address, email address, and a phone number. The only difference is that people have a birthday whereas business contacts have an opening time.

**Figure Eight**: A project that implements a card game, Crazy Eights, that mimicks the popular card game, Uno. This is designed to allow two or more users to play the game via keyboard input. A lot of the code used for this project has been reused from a previous project that I made, which implements the Solitaire card game. Those changes have been recorded in the *Changes.txt* file.

**Get In Line**: A project that implements a Sequence (using a linked list) that stores Strings and performs operations such as adding an item, removing an item, and searching for a particular item. The Sequence also grows and shrinks to facilitate the insertion and deletion of items.

**Graphical Editor**: A project that implements an object-oriented graphical editor applet that can be used to create and edit rectangles, ellipses, and line segments. Each of these can appear in either red, green, or blue. Additionally, the editor performs operations such as changing an object's color, moving an object, bringing an object to the front, pushing an object to the back, and exchanging the positions of two objects.  

**Infix to Postfix**: A project that implements an infix to postfix converter that converts parenthesized or unparenthesized infix expressions into their equivalent postfix expressions. This is done using the Stack ADT.
